# pro
a Java 9 compatible build tool

To compile and build pro, run 
```
build.sh
```
pro will bootstrap itself.
The bootstrap process only works with the latest jdk9-jigsaw build ! 


Once built, you have an image of the tool in target/pro,
this image embeds its own small JDK so no need to install anything Java related to play with it.
